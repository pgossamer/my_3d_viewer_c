# my_3d_viewer_c

Teamwork. The program is written in C/C++ \

Was given the task to write an application for 3d visualization of .obj files \

My tasks included a parser to read the .obj files, assigning colors to lines, points, backgrounds, as well as testing the correctness of affine transformations

To run the program you need to go to the *src folder* and write `make`
